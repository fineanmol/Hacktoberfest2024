# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Our Pledge
As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to foster a harassment-free community experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, sex characteristics, experience level, education, socio-economic background, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
Trolling, insults, derogatory comments, or personal attacks
Public or private harassment
Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for enforcing our standards and will take appropriate, fair action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when necessary.
