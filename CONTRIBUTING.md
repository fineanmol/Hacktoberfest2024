# Contribution Guidelines ðŸ“š

Welcome to Our Project!
Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please read the following guidelines carefully to ensure smooth collaboration.

## General Guidelines:
**Creativity Allowed:** If you have an idea that bends the rules, feel free to submit a pull request (PR). We may still merge it!
**No Build Steps:** Please avoid adding build steps (e.g., npm install). This project is intended to stay simple as a static site.
**Preserve Existing Content:**  Ensure you do not remove any existing content.
**Code Style:** Whether your code is clean or messy, simple or complexâ€”itâ€™s all welcome, as long as it works.
**Add Your Name:** Donâ€™t forget to add your name to the contributorsList file.
**Keep it Small:** Try to keep your pull requests small. This helps minimize merge conflicts and makes reviews easier.
