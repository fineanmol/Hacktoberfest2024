# Customized-Movie-Recommendation-System-
This is a single user system through which  the user can maintain and filter movies and obtain Customized recommendations by sorting them according to film name, Director ,Genre ,Year ,Main actor ,IMDB rating and Duration. Also it allows the user to watch the movie trailer and the full movie straight through the software and also the watched status can be marked so that the user may keep note of the previously watched films.
In general the customized movie recommendation system does the role of a sorter who filters and gives you exactly what you want, for an example  if you are in the mood for a classic 90’s movie you can simply enter your requirement (production year in this case ) and obtain a list of 90’s movies which you can further sort/filter  with Director ,Genre ,Year ,Main actor and IMDB rating if you like. And also the user can easily sort his local films as the system supports local file handling , and also the user can enter  an online URL to play the movie online .
So basically the system recommends movies after sorting or filtering them by the entered user requirements.
Also the system is user friendly in many ways as it enables data editing and comes with a help menu.
