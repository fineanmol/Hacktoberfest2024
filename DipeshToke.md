Introduction to Immersive Technologies
Immersive technologies create distinct experiences by merging the physical world with a digital or simulated reality. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are two principal types of immersive technologies. These technologies share many of the same qualities. However, AR blends computer-generated information onto the user’s real environment, while VR uses computer-generated information to provide a full sense of immersion.

There are three main types of Immersive Technologies
1 Virtural Reality
2 Augmented Reality
3 Mixed Reality

1 Virtural Reality
VR systems use head-mounted displays and input devices to provide a sense of immersion. Head-mounted displays cover the user’s field of view to display computer-generated content. Input devices such as joysticks, tracking balls, controller balls and data gloves allow the user to interact with the virtual environment.
1] In non-immersive VR, only a subset of a user’s senses is stimulated, allowing the user to maintain awareness of the physical environment outside of the virtual reality. For example, the HP Reverb Pro headset allows designers to create 3D models.

2] Semi-immersive VR leverages more senses than non-immersive VR, but still does not take advantage of all senses. For example, flight simulation allows pilots to learn how to fly different aircrafts through realistic displays that simulate different in-flight experiences.

3] Finally, fully-immersive VR stimulates all of the user’s senses. For example, Infinadeck has created an omnichannel treadmill that allows users to move within a virtual environment.

2 Augmented Reality
AR relies on processors, a display, sensors and input devices to create an experience. There are four types of AR:

1] Marker-based AR uses a visual marker, like a QR code, to produce a result. For example, Snapchat uses marker-based AR to help its users add people to their contact lists.

2] Markerless AR uses GPS or a digital compass, velocity meter or accelerometer to provide data. Google Maps Live View uses markerless AR to navigate users to their destination.

3] Projection-based AR projects artificial light onto surfaces. For example, researchers at the Digital Nature Group used lasers, mirrors and cameras to create a hologram-like experience, which can be felt by the user.

4] Superimposition partially or fully replaces the original view of an object with a new view. IKEA and GOAT are two companies taking advantage of this technology. IKEA allows users to preview furniture in their house on their smartphone, while GOAT enables users to use their smartphone to superimpose the latest sneakers on their feet.

3 Mixed Reality
Mixed reality (MR) is a term used to describe the merging of a real-world environment and a computer-generated one. Physical and virtual objects may co-exist in mixed reality environments and interact in real time.Mixed reality is sometimes referred to as a hybrid of augmented reality and virtual reality.

1] Environmental input and perception.

2] The mixed reality spectrum.

3] Augmented vs. virtual reality.

4] Holographic devices are characterized by the device's ability to display digital objects as if they existed in the real world. Immersive VR devices are characterized by the device's ability to create a sense of presence by blocking out the physical world and replacing it with a fully immersive digital experience.
