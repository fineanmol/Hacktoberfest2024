Java program is a collection of objects, and these objects communicate through method calls to each other to work together. Here is a brief discussion on the Classes and Objects, Method, Instance variables, syntax, and semantics of Java.

Basic terminologies in Java
1. Class: The class is a blueprint (plan) of the instance of a class (object). It can be defined as a template that describes the data and behavior associated with its instance.

Example: Blueprint of the house is class.
2. Object: The object is an instance of a class. It is an entity that has behavior and state.

Example: A car is an object whose states are: brand, color, and number plate.
Behavior: Running on the road.
3. Method: The behavior of an object is the method.


Example: The fuel indicator indicates the amount of fuel left in the car.
4. Instance variables: Every object has its own unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is generally created by the values that are assigned to these instance variables.

Example: Steps to compile and run a java program in a console

javac GFG.java
java GFG

public class GFG {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println("GFG!");
	}
}
