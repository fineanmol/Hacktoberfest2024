What is Multilevel Inheritance In Java?

In Java (and in other object-oriented languages) a class can get features from another class. This mechanism is known as inheritance.

When multiple classes are involved and their parent-child relation is formed in a chained way then such formation is known as multi-level inheritance.
In multilevel inheritance, a parent a class has a maximum of one direct child class only.
In multi-level inheritance, the inheritance linkage is formed in a linear way and minimum 3 classes are involved.
Code re-usability can be extended with multi-level inheritance.

class Person

{

Person()

{

System.out.println("Person constructor");

}

void nationality()

{

System.out.println("Indian");

}

void place()

{

System.out.println("Mumbai");

}

}

class Emp extends Person

{

Emp()

{

System.out.println("Emp constructor");

}

void organization()

{

System.out.println("IBM");

}

void place()

{

System.out.println("New York");

}

}

class Manager extends Emp

{

Manager()

{

System.out.println("Manager constructor");

}

void subordinates()

{

System.out.println(12);

}

void place()

{

System.out.println("London");

}

}

class Check

{

public static void main(String arg[])

{

Manager m=new Manager();

m.nationality();

m.organization();

m.subordinates();

m.place();

}

}
