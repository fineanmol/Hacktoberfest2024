Multilevel inheritance refers to a mechanism in OO technology where one can
inherit from a derived class, thereby making this derived class the base class
for the new class. As you can see in below flow diagram C is subclass or child class of 
B and B is a child class of A. For more details and example refer â€“ Multilevel inheritance in Java.

Class X
{
   public void methodX()
   {
     System.out.println("Class X method");
   }
}
Class Y extends X
{
public void methodY()
{
System.out.println("class Y method");
}
}
Class Z extends Y
{
   public void methodZ()
   {
     System.out.println("class Z method");
   }
   public static void main(String args[])
   {
     Z obj = new Z();
     obj.methodX(); //calling grand parent class method
     obj.methodY(); //calling parent class method
     obj.methodZ(); //calling local method
  }
}
