<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii">2402. Meeting Rooms III</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><p>You are given an integer <code>n</code>. There are <code>n</code> rooms numbered from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>.</p>

<p>You are given a 2D integer array <code>meetings</code> where <code>meetings[i] = [start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>]</code> means that a meeting will be held during the <strong>half-closed</strong> time interval <code>[start<sub>i</sub>, end<sub>i</sub>)</code>. All the values of <code>start<sub>i</sub></code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</p>

<p>Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</li>
	<li>If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the <strong>same</strong> duration as the original meeting.</li>
	<li>When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original <strong>start</strong> time should be given the room.</li>
</ol>

<p>Return<em> the <strong>number</strong> of the room that held the most meetings. </em>If there are multiple rooms, return<em> the room with the <strong>lowest</strong> number.</em></p>

<p>A <strong>half-closed interval</strong> <code>[a, b)</code> is the interval between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> <strong>including</strong> <code>a</code> and <strong>not including</strong> <code>b</code>.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.
