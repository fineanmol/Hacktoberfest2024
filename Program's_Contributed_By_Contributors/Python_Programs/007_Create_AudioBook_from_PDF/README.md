# Create AudioBook from PDF

In this class, you'll learn how to create audiobook from PDF using python                                                            


## Prerequisites:

1.  <b> Python Basics </b>
2.  <b> PyPDF2 module </b>
3.  <b> pyttsx3 module </b>

---


## Install Necessary Modules:

Open your [![Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/Anaconda-342B029.svg?&style=flate&logo=anaconda&logoColor=white)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Prompt <img alt="propmt" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-__-000000?style=flat-square&logo=Plex&logoColor=white"> and type and run the following command (individually):

 -       pip install PyPDF2  
 -       pip install pyttsx3
 
 
**[`PyPDF2`](https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/)** is a python library built as a PDF toolkit. It is capable of extracting document information splitting documents page by page merging documents page by page cropping pages merging multiple pages into a single page encrypting and decrypting PDF files and more!

**[`pyttsx3`](https://pyttsx3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python. Unlike alternative libraries, it works offline, and is compatible with both Python 2 and 3.

Once Installed now we can import it inside our python code.

### How can I read this tutorial without an Internet connection? <img alt="GIF" src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/hmm.gif" width="21" />

1. Go [**`here`**](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects) and click the big green ➞ **`Code`** button in the top right of the page, then click ➞ [**`Download ZIP`**](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

    ![Download ZIP](https://github.com/milaan9/91_Python_Mini_Projects/blob/main/img/dnld_rep.png)

2. Extract the ZIP and open it. Unfortunately I don't have any more specific instructions because how exactly this is done depends on which operating system you run.
    
3. Launch ipython notebook from the folder which contains the notebooks. Open each one of them
  
    `Kernel > Restart & Clear Output`
    
This will clear all the outputs and now you can understand each statement and learn interactively.

If you have git and you know how to use it, you can also clone the repository instead of downloading a zip and extracting it. An advantage with doing it this way is that you don't need to download the whole tutorial again to get the latest version of it, all you need to do is to pull with git and run ipython notebook again.
