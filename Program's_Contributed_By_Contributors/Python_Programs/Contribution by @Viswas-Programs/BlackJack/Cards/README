SVG-cards 2.0.1 
---------------

This is a set of playing cards made in pure SVG with all kings, queens, jacks, numbers, jokers and backs of cards. This set of SVG files is intended to be used in games, figures, illustrations, web sites as long as you provide the code source and the LGPL license (see the COPYING file). Although this is a free software, the license is the LGPL so you can use this set of cards even in a non-free software.

The kings, queens and jacks are based on the french representation, because I find them beautiful. You can access to each either by rendering the file into a pixmap and clipping each card or by using their name with a DOM interface. All cards are inside a SVG group.
Example :
the king of spade is inside this group :

<g id="king_spade">
...
</g>

Names are the following :

black_joker
red_joker
back
{king,queen,jack}_{club,diamond,heart,spade}
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}_{club,diamond,heart,spade}

Examples :
- the ace of club is 1_club
- the queen of diamond is queen_diamond

and so on...


These cards have been made with GNOME games in mind and have been succesfully tested with Nautilus, Eye of Gnome (both of them use librsvg) and Inkscape.

Enjoy!
