# ParodyWindows11
A parody of an operating system. the name I chose is Windows 11
Look for more in the wiki of my project in (https://github.com/Viswas-Programs/ParodyWindows11/wiki) there.

Easy setup (if github servers work): For linux only, run dos2unix command on the Bash script, and then run the file in linux terminal, in the directory you want to install, and run the file.

Manual Setup:

Step1: Download the windows 11 file

Step2: Download the ProgramFiles zip file and extract that thing into the environment.

Step3: make a new file "accConfiguration1.conf" (yes the file type is .conf) and give your username in first line and password in second line.

Now the directory structure should look similar to this

YOURENV/

---------ProgramFiles/

------------------Icons/

---------------------------ALLICONS

------------------defaultuser0/<all files>

------------------<YOUR_USER_NAME>/

---------------------------<YOUR_USER_FILES>

------------------All Apps

------------------accConfiguration1.conf

---------Windows 11.py

---------theme_config.txt

If so, you're officially done with the manual setup! have a great time playing around!
