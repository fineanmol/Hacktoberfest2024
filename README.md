## 🔄 Syncing Your Fork to Avoid Conflicts

To avoid conflicts, add an 'upstream' for your repo, as other PRs might get merged while you're working.

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2024
```

Verify the new remote by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Pull changes from the parent repo:

```bash
git merge upstream/master
```

This will allow you to solve any conflicts before pushing your changes.
