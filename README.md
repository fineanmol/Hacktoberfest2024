# Hacktoberfest 2k18

<a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com">Hacktoberfest</a> is an initiative by GitHub and Digital Ocean to get more people involved in Open Source. This year, even Twilio has joined hands with them.<br>

Hacktoberfest runs throughout the month of October and every individual with 5 or more PRs made (not necessary to be accepted and merged) gets stickers and a limited edition hacktoberfest t-shirt.<br>

It's a great way to start off your journey into open source.<br>

For starters, we'll be creating a file called <a href="https://github.com/fineanmol/Hacktoberfest2k18/blob/master/hacktoberfest/intros.md">intro.md</a>. Add the s.no, your name embedded within a link to your github profile and you batch.<br>

Over the month, we'll be launching a couple of issues which you guys can solve in order to make sure that you all get to make 5 PRs and are eligible for the Hacktoberfest t-shirt.<br>

## Stay tuned people!
