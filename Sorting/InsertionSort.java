// Insertion Sort builds a sorted list one element at a time by comparing and inserting elements in their correct positions.
// Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)

// Insertion Sort:
// Start with the second element:

// Treat the first element as a sorted sublist of one element.
// Compare the second element with the first one and place it in the correct position.
// Move to the next element:

// Pick the next element from the unsorted part and compare it with elements in the sorted part.
// Shift elements if necessary:

// If the new element is smaller than elements in the sorted part, shift the larger elements one position to the right to make space for the new element.
// Insert the element:

// Place the element in its correct position in the sorted sublist.
// Repeat:

// Repeat the process for each element in the unsorted part until the entire array is sorted.
