Certainly! Here's a simple Java program for a text-based guessing game called "Number Guess." In this game, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess the number.


import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.Random;

public class NumberGuessGame {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        int lowerBound = 1;
        int upperBound = 100;
        int numberToGuess = random.nextInt(upperBound - lowerBound + 1) + lowerBound;
        int numberOfTries = 0;
        boolean hasGuessedCorrectly = false;

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guess Game!");
        System.out.println("I've selected a random number between 1 and 100. Try to guess it.");

        while (!hasGuessedCorrectly) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            int userGuess = scanner.nextInt();
            numberOfTries++;

            if (userGuess < numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too low! Try a higher number.");
            } else if (userGuess > numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("Too high! Try a lower number.");
            } else {
                hasGuessedCorrectly = true;
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You guessed the number " + numberToGuess + " correctly in " + numberOfTries + " tries.");
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
