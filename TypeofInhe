Hierarchical Inheritance
In such kind of inheritance one class is inherited by many sub classes. In below example class B,C and D inherits the same class A. A is parent class (or base class) of B,C & D. Read More at â€“ Hierarchical Inheritance in java with example program.

What is Multilevel Inheritance In Java? In Java (and in other object-oriented languages) a class can get features from another class. This mechanism is known as inheritance. When multiple classes are involved and their parent-child relation i
s formed in a chained way then such formation is known as multi-level inheritance.

 Hybrid Inheritance
In simple terms you can say that Hybrid inheritance is a combination of Single and Multiple inheritance. A typical flow diagram would look like below. A hybrid inheritance can be achieved in the java in a same way as multiple inheritance can be!! Using interfaces. yes you heard it right. By using interfaces you can have multiple as well as hybrid inheritance in Java.

Single Inheritance
Single inheritance is damn easy to understand. When a class extends another one class only then we  call it a single inheritance. The below flow diagram shows that class B extends only one class which is A. Here A is a parent class of B and B would be  a child class of A.
